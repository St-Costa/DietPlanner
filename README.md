## What
DietManager is a tool designed to help users plan and modify their weekly diets with ease.   
It enables proactive meal planning for users aiming for body recomposition or other nutrition goals.

## Why I'm doing this
Most diet tools help users track food intake **in real-time**, **while** eating.   
However, for effective [body recomposition](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/body-recomposition), it's essential to **plan and adjust** your diet in advance.   
DietManager allows users to easily plan, modify, and optimize their diet over time.
