## What
DietManager is a tool designed to help users plan and modify their weekly diets with ease. 
It enables proactive meal planning for users aiming for body recomposition or other nutrition goals.

## Why I'm doing this
Most current diet tools only help users track food intake **in real-time**, focusing on calories and macronutrients **while** eating. 
However, for effective body recomposition, it's essential to **plan and adjust** your diet in advance. 
DietManager allows users to easily plan, modify, and optimize their diet over time, making it perfect for those looking to take control of their nutrition strategy.
